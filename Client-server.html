		  	The project is relative to the educational vision-monitored temperature control system described in the latter chapter, except EtherCAT communication between RPi1 and Arduino is replaced by USB communication. The environment temperature is measured and when it exceeds a set point, a fan is controlled to regulate the difference between set and current temperatures towards zero. A camera is used to monitor the rotation of the fan. The set temperature, the image of the fan as well as the various measurements taken, such as set temperature, current temperature, fan speed and the value of the command sent to the fan, are displayed on a console.
